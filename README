INSTALLATION
============

Dependencies
------------
The following software must be installed first:

- docker-ce

RUNNING
----------

From github:

git pull https://github.com/PIRCImagingTools/NeBSS


Input: T2 weighted scans, in nifty format T1 input will also work but is more of a work

Two options to make NeBSS Docker image. 
---------------------------------------

     1. Building NeBSS image from Dockerfile. 
            1. Within NeBSS folder run docker build command: 
                'docker build -t nebss_prod:latest .'

    2. Importing NeBSS image from pre-built image
            1. Download image and move to folder with image. 
            2. Docker import <image.tar> nebss_prod:latest -nebss_prod:latest

Creating a NeBSS Function
---------------------------------------

    1. Helpful tip to run NeBSS Docker Image is to add a function to ${HOME}/.bashrc:
        'function NeBSS {docker run -it --user=$UID:$UID -v $(pwd):/data nebss_prod "$@"; }'

    2. From here forward, documentation will use the 'NeBSS' function to run. You can replace any instance of 'NeBSS' from here out with
        'docker run -it --user=$UID:$UID -v $(pwd):/data nebss_prod' and the result will be the same.  

Running NeBSS - Step-by-step guide
---------------------------------------

    1. Create a new parent folder for each case for the output
        mkdir <casename>

    2. Create config file using
        'NeBSS config <image file>
        
        Answer config setup questions as follows: 

            1. PID = <patID>, 

            2. T2 Weighted? = Is image T2 Y/N
            
            3. Crop Coordiates: Use viewing software like fsleyes to determine MR boundaries. 
                You want the Voxel Location, which is the grid coordinate of the voxel, ranging from 0 to total number of voxels in that direction (positive numbers, X1 is always smaller than X2).

            4. Image Center = Divide Coordinate locations by 2. 
                Example: x0=0, x1=100, x-center=50

            5. Albert group: (early preterm, late preterm, term)

            6. PCA = post conceptional age in weeks, 
            
            Notes: 
                No definite convention exists, but: coronal acquired usually: X=RL, Y=IS, Z=AP,  sagitally acquired usually: X=AP, Y=IS, Z=RL for example. Z is usually the image "slices". MNI space is: X = RL, Y=AP, Z=IS.

                The scanner/anatomical coordinates start with 0 in the center of the volume, and will go positive/negative moving away from that. You don't want these coordinates. 
                    see: https://itk.org/Wiki/File:DICOM-OrientationDiagram-LPS.png


                If your input is a T1 or the FSE is >3mm, use T1 image and add FSE and run RegFSE and use the output as input for structural T2.


    3. Run NeBSS using command
        'NeBSS <relative/path/to/config.json>

After Running:
---------------------------------------

    Quick check: Segmentation.png

    Output folder: <casename>/SegT2/Outputs/ 

    Output: Albert_wta.nii = nifti segmentation masks

    Check the output in fsleyes: the segmentation will be the Albert_wta file, overlayed on the T2_bias_corrected image
