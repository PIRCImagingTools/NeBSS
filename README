**NEonatal Brain Structure Segmentation**
==============================================

INSTALLATION
============

Dependencies
------------
The following software must be installed first:

- fsl
- ants 

Get these from pip (rather than apt-get on Debian)
- nipy
- nipype


CONFIGURATION
--------------
Add to config file the location of your ALBERT atlas directories
-- Downloaded from source


RUNNING
----------

From github:

git pull https://github.com/PIRCImagingTools/NeBSS

cd into directory (or add sortcut)

python nebss_gui.py


Input: T2 weighted scans, in nifty format T1 input will also work but is more of a work 

learn how to convert here:

dcm2niix - software to convert dicom to nifti format, 
documentation https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage
download https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix.

Output: Albert_wta.nii = nifti segmentation masks
Step-by-step guide
1.Create a new parent folder for each case for the output

mkdir <casename>


2. Run NeBSS

nebss_gui.py

3. a. This will open a graphic user interface

PID = <patID>, PCA = post conceptional age in weeks, choose Albert group (early preterm, late preterm, term)
Parent Dir: path/to/parent/folder/<casename>
Struct T2: path/to/inputfile/T2.nii

Define cropping dimensions: open T2.nii file in fsleyes to define boundaries:

You want the Voxel Location, which is the grid coordinate of the voxel, ranging from 0 to total number of voxels in that direction (positive numbers, X1 is always smaller than X2).
No definite convention exists, but: coronal acquired usually: X=RL, Y=IS, Z=AP,  sagitally acquired usually: X=AP, Y=IS, Z=RL for example. Z is usually the image "slices". MNI space is: X = RL, Y=AP, Z=IS.

NOTE: The scanner/anatomical coordinates start with 0 in the center of the volume, and will go positive/negative moving away from that. You don't want these coordinates. 
see: https://itk.org/Wiki/File:DICOM-OrientationDiagram-LPS.png


If your input is a T1 or the FSE is >3mm, use T1 image and add FSE and run RegFSE and use the output as input for structural T2.

b. Save config before running

c. Click T2seg to run segmentation (this will take about 20h)

Quick check: Segmentation.png

Output folder: <casename>/SegT2/Outputs/ 

Check the output in fsleyes: the segmentation will be the Albert_wta file, overlayed on the T2_bias_corrected image
